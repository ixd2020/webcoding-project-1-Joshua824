  <div id="starrynight2"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f87dacb1-7677-4e98-a074-0f0c541c97f6%2FStarrynight.jpg?v=1606546837944" alt="Starry Night Art Work" class="responsive" width="550px" height="430px"></div>
  <div class="divtextbox"><p class="divtext">Painted in 1889, Vincent was staying at the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near Saint-Remy-de Provence. He was fine living
in the hospital and had more freedom given to him as compared to the other patients there. If accompanied, he was able to 
leave the hospital grounds for activities such as painting and reading. A studio was also provided for him to do such
activities. He suffered from occasional relapse into paranoia and fits and had been diagnosed with epileptic fits though it
seemed his mental health was slowly recovering. Unforunately, he started to relapse. Hallucination and thoughts of suicide 
came to him as he slowly fell into depression. Due to this, a tonal shift in his work started to begin. Incorporation of
the dark colors from when he started his artistic career returned and Starry Nightwas a great example of that. The painting 
is mostly blue with the blend of hills into the sky. Every building is outlined in black with the stars and the moon painted
in yellow and white standing out against the sky thus giving off attention to the sky. They are the big attention grabbers of this
    painting.</p></div>
     
  <div class="titlebox2"><p class="divtext33">The Potato Eaters ( Completed in April 1885 )</p></div>
  <div id="potatoeaters2"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f87dacb1-7677-4e98-a074-0f0c541c97f6%2Fpotatoeater3.jpg?v=1606549709920" alt="The Potato Eaters Art Work" class="responsive" width="550px" height="430px"></div>
  <div class="divtextbox2"><p class="divtext">Vincent Van Gogh wished to create a masterpiece that could boost his reputation as a developing artist; the goal was to paint human figures that do not look awkward, but rather just exists naturally. However,portraying the figures in a dark room with light from an oil lamp proved to be a bit too extreme for his newly acquired artistic skills. Counting all the factors that led to this outcome in turn, made the painting more appreciated in the art community then if Van Gogh had succeeded in his original task.The completed painting consisted of 5 figures sitting around a square table eating potatoes thus called The Potato Eaters; four of them are females and one male. Although the piece is covered with darkness, the mixed emotions residing in the faces of the occupants brightly stand out. These figures are so intense to the point that one can nearly hear the conversations being spoken around the table. Perhaps this vibrancy layered with the darkness is what draws one closer to examine the smaller details of the painting. </p></div>
  
  
  <div class="titlebox3"><p class="divtext32">The Yellow House -The Streets ( Completed in May 1888 )</p></div>
  <div id="theyellowhouse2"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f87dacb1-7677-4e98-a074-0f0c541c97f6%2Fthe%20yellowhouse3.jpg?v=1606549991007" alt="The Yellow House - The Streets Art Work" class="responsive" width="550px" height="430px"></div>
  <div class="divtextbox3"><p class="divtext">In May 1888, Van Gogh rented four rooms in a house on Place Lamartine in Arles (southern France). The green shutters in this painting of the square show where he lived. Shortly after moving into the ‘Yellow House’, he sent Theo a description and sketch of his painting of it: ‘it’s tremendous, these yellow houses in the sunlight and then the incomparable freshness of the blue.’The work, which Van Gogh himself called ‘The Street’, records the artist’s immediate surroundings: he often ate at the restaurant on the left, and the home of his friend, the postman Joseph Roulin, lay just beyond the second railway bridge.Vincent had finally found a place at the Yellow House where he could not only paint but also have his friends come to stay. His plan was to turn the yellow corner-building into an artists’ house, where like-minded painters could live and work together.</p></div> 
   
  
  <div class="titlebox4"><p class="divtext33">Café Terrace at Night ( Completed in September 1888 )</p></div>
  <div id="cafe2"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f87dacb1-7677-4e98-a074-0f0c541c97f6%2Fcafe.jpg?v=1606559966938" alt="Café Terrace at Night Art Work" class="responsive" height="500px"></div>
  <div class="divtextbox4"><p class="divtext">This painting of a colorful outdoor view is a picturesque work, the vision of a relaxed spectator who enjoys the charm of his surrounding without any moral concern. It recalls Van Gogh's mood when he wrote that "the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day." The color is more profuse and the eye wanders along the steeped or dove-tailed edges of neighboring areas - irregular shapes fitted to each other like a jigsaw puzzle design. To divide this space for long into a large object and background themes is difficult for the eyes; the distant and nearer parts are alike distinct. The yellow of the cafe plays against the blue-black of the remote street and the violet-blue of the foreground door, and, by a paradox of composition that helps to unify the work, at the strongest point of contrast the awning's blunt corner nearest to us touches the remote blue sky. Foreshortened lines that thrust into depth, like the lintel of the door, are strictly parallel to lines like the slope of the yellow awning and the roof of the house above, which lie in planes perpendicular to the first. For this roving, unengaged vision the upward dimension is no less important and expressive than the depth.</p></div>
  
   
  <div class="titlebox5"><p class="divtext2">Van Gogh Self Portrait ( Completed in September 1889 )</p></div>
  <div id="vangogh2"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f87dacb1-7677-4e98-a074-0f0c541c97f6%2Fvincent.jpg?v=1606559956822" alt="Van Gogh Self Portrait Art Work" class="responsive" height="500px" width="450px"></div>
  <div class="divtextbox5"><p class="divtext">This self-portrait was one of about 30 Vincnent Van Gogh produced over a 10-year period, and these were an important part of his work as a painter;he would paint himself because he often lacked the money to pay for models.He took the painting with him to Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr Paul Gachet, who thought it was "absolutely fanatical". Art historians are divided as to whether this painting or Self-portrait without beard is Vincent Van Gogh's final self-portrait. Ingo F Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last, with Hulsker considering that it was painted in Arles following Van Gogh's admission to hospital after mutilating his ear, while Ronald Pickvance thinks Self-portrait without beard was the later painting.Van Gogh sent the picture to his younger brother, the art dealer Theo; an accompanying letter read: "You will need to study the picture for a time. I hope you will notice that my facial expressions have become much calmer, although my eyes have the same insecure look as before, or so it appears to me."The art historians Walther and Metzger consider that "the picture is not a pretty pose nor a realistic record ... [it is] one that has seen too much jeopardy, too much turmoil, to be able to keep its agitation and trembling under control." According to Beckett the dissolving colours and same time turbulent patterns signal a feeling of strain and pressure, symbolising the artist's state of mind, which is under a mental, physical and emotional pressure.The Musée d'Orsay in Paris, who obtained the picture in 1986,consider that "the model's immobility contrasts with the undulating hair and beard, echoed and amplified in the hallucinatory arabesques of the background." </p> </div>
  
  <div class="titlebox6"><p class="divtext2">Starry Night Over the Rhône ( Completed in September 1888 )</p></div>
  <div id="rhone2"><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f87dacb1-7677-4e98-a074-0f0c541c97f6%2Fsei26139543-1-0.jpg?v=1606570838583" alt="Starry Night Over The Art Work Rhône" class="responsive" height="330px" width="700px"></div>
  <div class="divtextbox6"><p class="divtext">Starry Night Over the Rhone was painted at a spot on the banks of river which was only a minute or two's walk from the The Yellow House on the Place Lamartine which Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night provided the subject for some of his more famous paintings, including The Starry Night, the most famous Van Gogh night stars painting. The challenge of painting at night intrigued Van Gogh. The vantage point he chose for "Starry Night Over the Rhone" allowed him to capture the reflections of the gas lighting in Arles across the glimmering blue water of the Rhone. In the foreground, two lovers stroll by the banks of the river. Here his stars glow with a luminescence, shining from the dark, blue and velvety night sky. Dotted along the banks of the Rhone houses also radiate a light that reflects in the water and adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the painting.</p></div>
